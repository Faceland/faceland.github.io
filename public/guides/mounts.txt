# Mount Equipment
Mounts can be outfitted with equipment that enhances their capabilities and appearance.

- Saddles increase the base movement speed of your mount
- Armor plating reduces the damage your mount takes from enemies
- Saddlebags expand your carrying capacity while mounted
- Decorative barding changes the visual appearance of your mount
- Horseshoes provide small bonuses like reduced stamina drain

%Mount equipment is crafted by leatherworkers and metalworkers with specialized recipes.

# Mount Stamina
Mounts have a stamina bar that depletes while sprinting. When stamina runs out, the mount slows to walking pace until it regenerates. Managing your mount's stamina by alternating between sprinting and trotting lets you cover more ground efficiently on long journeys.
