- Higher tiers provide better end-of-season rewards

- Seasonal resets give everyone a fresh start with placement matches

# Arena Tips
Study your opponents during the opening seconds of each match to identify their build and adjust your strategy accordingly. Positioning and cooldown management are often more important than raw damage output. Practice in casual matches before entering ranked to refine your technique.
