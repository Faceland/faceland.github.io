# Dungeons
%Descend into darkness and face the deadliest challenges Faceland has to offer.

Dungeons are instanced multi-room challenges filled with powerful enemies, devious traps, and valuable loot. They represent the pinnacle of PvE content and require skill, preparation, and often a coordinated group.

# Loot and Rewards
Dungeons provide some of the best rewards available in Faceland.

- Boss enemies drop rare and epic equipment with unique stat rolls
- Treasure chests appear in hidden rooms and after boss defeats
- Dungeon currency is earned for completing runs and spent at special vendors

# Dungeon Preparation
Success in dungeons begins before you ever enter. Stock up on health and mana potions, ensure your equipment is repaired and enchanted, and coordinate roles with your group. Having a balanced party with damage dealers, a tank, and a support player makes most dungeons significantly easier.
