# Character Stats
%Understanding your stats is the foundation of becoming a powerful adventurer.

Every player in Faceland has a set of core attributes that determine their effectiveness in combat, crafting, and exploration. As you level up and acquire better gear, these stats will grow and shape your playstyle.

# Primary Attributes
Your primary attributes form the backbone of your character build. Each one influences different aspects of gameplay.

- Strength increases your melee damage and carrying capacity
- Dexterity improves your attack speed and critical hit chance
- Intelligence boosts your magical damage and mana pool
- Vitality raises your maximum health and health regeneration
- Endurance affects your stamina and physical damage resistance

%Primary attributes can be increased through leveling, equipment, and special upgrades.

# Secondary Stats
Secondary stats are derived from your primary attributes and equipment bonuses. They provide more specific combat advantages.

- Critical Hit Chance determines how often you land devastating blows
- Armor Rating reduces incoming physical damage by a percentage
- Magic Resist lowers the impact of enemy spells and abilities
- Life Steal returns a portion of damage dealt as health
- Movement Speed affects how quickly you traverse the world

# How Stats Scale
Stats in Faceland follow a diminishing returns curve. The first few points in any attribute provide the largest benefit, while later points offer smaller incremental gains. This encourages balanced builds rather than dumping everything into a single stat.

- Each point of Strength adds roughly 2 melee damage at low levels
- Armor Rating soft caps at around 60% damage reduction
- Critical Hit Chance is most efficient between 15% and 40%
- Movement Speed bonuses are halved beyond 130% base speed

%Experiment with different stat distributions to find the build that suits your playstyle best.
