# The Marketplace
The central marketplace is where players list items for sale and browse offers from others. It operates as a persistent auction-style system.

- List items for sale at any marketplace kiosk in major towns
- Set your own asking price or use the suggested market value
- Listings remain active for 48 hours before expiring
- Sold items deliver currency directly to your account
- A small listing fee is charged to prevent spam listings

%Check current market prices before listing to avoid underselling valuable items.

# Direct Trading
For immediate transactions, players can trade directly with each other face to face.

- Approach another player and send a trade request
- Both parties place items and currency into the trade window
- Both must confirm before the trade executes
- A trade log records all transactions for dispute resolution
- Direct trades have no listing fee but require both players to be present
