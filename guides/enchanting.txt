# Enchanting
%Infuse your equipment with arcane power to transcend ordinary limits.

Enchanting allows you to add magical properties to your equipment, granting bonus stats, special effects, and elemental damage. A well-enchanted loadout can be the difference between victory and defeat in challenging content.

# The Enchanting Table
Enchanting is performed at an Enchanting Table, a specialized station found in major cities and certain dungeon safe rooms.

- Place an enchantable item on the table to see available enchantments
- Select the desired enchantment and provide the required materials
- The enchantment is applied instantly upon successful completion
- Items marked with the enchantable tag in the database can be enchanted
- Each item can hold one enchantment at a time

%Replacing an existing enchantment destroys the previous one permanently.

# Types of Enchantments
Enchantments fall into several categories depending on the equipment slot and desired effect.

- Elemental enchantments add fire, ice, or lightning damage to weapons
- Defensive enchantments boost armor, magic resist, or health on armor pieces
- Utility enchantments improve movement speed, gathering rates, or experience gain
- Vampiric enchantments grant life steal or mana steal on hit
- Thorns enchantments reflect a portion of incoming damage back to attackers

# Enchanting Materials
The materials needed for enchanting are distinct from crafting materials and are obtained through specific activities.

- Arcane Dust drops from magical enemies and is the base enchanting material
- Elemental Cores are found in biome-specific areas and grant elemental enchantments
- Enchanted Scrolls provide rare enchantment recipes
- Void Crystals are premium materials that unlock the most powerful enchantments

%Disenchanting unwanted magical items is a reliable source of arcane dust.

# Enchanting Strategy
Focus enchantments that complement your build. A melee fighter benefits most from elemental weapon enchantments and defensive armor enchantments. Casters should prioritize mana-related enchantments and utility boosts. Always enchant your highest rarity gear first to maximize value.
