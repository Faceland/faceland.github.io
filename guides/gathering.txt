# Gathering
%Forage the wilds and collect nature's bounty.

Gathering is the art of collecting herbs, flowers, mushrooms, and other natural materials from the environment. These resources are essential ingredients for alchemy, cooking, and various crafting recipes.

# How Gathering Works
Gatherable resources spawn throughout the world in specific biomes. Walk up to a glowing plant or resource node and interact with it to collect the material.

- Each resource type grows in a preferred biome and climate
- Gathered nodes respawn after a short cooldown period
- Higher level resources require a minimum gathering skill to harvest
- Some rare resources only appear during specific weather or time of day

%Keep an eye out for sparkling nodes, which indicate rare resource spawns.

# Resource Categories
Gathered materials fall into several broad categories, each serving different purposes.

- Herbs are used primarily in alchemy for potion brewing
- Flowers provide ingredients for dyes, perfumes, and special recipes
- Mushrooms are versatile ingredients used in both cooking and alchemy
- Bark and sap come from trees and are used in crafting recipes
- Wild vegetables and fruits serve as cooking ingredients
