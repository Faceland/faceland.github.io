# Outposts
%Claim territory, defend your ground, and dominate the frontier.

Outposts are capturable territorial locations spread across the wilderness of Faceland. Guilds compete to control outposts, which provide resource bonuses, strategic advantages, and bragging rights.

# Capturing an Outpost
Taking control of an outpost requires coordination, combat skill, and determination.

- Approach an unclaimed or enemy-held outpost with your guild
- Begin the capture process by interacting with the outpost flag
- Defend the capture point against enemy players and NPC guards
- The capture bar fills over several minutes of uncontested control
- Once captured, the outpost flies your guild's banner

%Outpost captures are contested events. Bring a full group and prepare for a fight.

# Outpost Benefits
Controlling outposts provides significant advantages to the holding guild.

- Resource nodes near the outpost generate bonus materials for your guild
- A respawn point is established at controlled outposts
- Vendor access allows buying and selling without returning to town
- Defensive structures can be built to fortify your position
- Nearby gathering and mining yields are increased for guild members

# Defending Your Outpost
Once captured, rival guilds will attempt to take your outpost. Maintaining control requires vigilance.

- Build walls, turrets, and barriers using guild resources
- Station guild members as guards during peak attack hours
- Upgrade the outpost's NPC defenders for passive protection
- Set traps along common approach routes to slow attackers
- Reinforce the capture point to extend the time needed to recapture

%Well-defended outposts can hold for days, providing sustained income for your guild.

# Outpost Warfare
Large-scale outpost battles are some of the most exciting events in Faceland. When multiple guilds converge on a valuable outpost, the resulting conflict tests strategy, teamwork, and individual skill. Coordinate with your guild to time assaults during off-peak hours or mount surprise raids.
