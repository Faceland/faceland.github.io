# Raising Your Pet
Pets gain experience alongside you and grow stronger over time.

- Pets level up by participating in combat encounters
- Higher level pets deal more damage and have improved abilities
- Feeding your pet improves its happiness and grants temporary bonuses
- Pet treats are crafted through the cooking profession
- A happy pet performs better in combat and activates abilities more often

%Check your pet's happiness regularly. An unhappy pet may refuse to fight.

# Pet Stable
You can own multiple pets but only have one active at a time. Your remaining pets are stored in the Pet Stable, accessible from any major town. Swap your active pet at the stable based on the content you are tackling, as different pets excel in different situations.
